# Systematic Debugging

Purpose: Find root causes before attempting fixes. Applies to code bugs, MCP integration failures, hook script errors, website build failures and vault system malfunctions.
Trigger: Any technical issue — error messages, unexpected behavior, failing tests, broken integrations, hooks not firing.
Inputs: Error message, symptom description, recent changes, system context.
Outputs: Root cause identification, single targeted fix, verification that the fix resolved the issue.
Status: active

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you have not completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes. Seeing symptoms is not understanding root cause.

## When to Use

Any technical issue: test failures, MCP errors, hook failures, build failures, deployment issues, unexpected output, integration breakdowns.

Use especially when:
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- A "quick fix" seems obvious
- Multiple fixes have already been tried
- The previous fix did not work
- You do not fully understand the issue

## The Four Phases

Complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

Before attempting any fix:

1. **Read error messages carefully.** Stack traces, line numbers, error codes. They often contain the answer.

2. **Reproduce consistently.** Can you trigger it reliably? What are the exact steps? If not reproducible, gather more data before guessing.

3. **Check recent changes.** What changed that could cause this? Git diff, recent commits, new MCP configurations, environment changes.

4. **Gather evidence in multi-component systems.** When the system has multiple layers (e.g., hook script calling an ecosystem script calling an external API), add diagnostic instrumentation at each boundary before proposing fixes:

   For each component boundary:
   - Log what data enters the component
   - Log what data exits
   - Verify environment and config propagation at that layer
   - Check state at each boundary

   Run once to gather evidence showing where it breaks. Analyze the evidence. Then investigate the failing component specifically.

5. **Trace data flow.** Where does the bad value originate? What called this with the bad value? Keep tracing up until you find the source. Fix at source, not at symptom.

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

Find the pattern before fixing:

1. **Find working examples.** Locate similar working code or configuration in the same context.

2. **Compare against references.** If implementing a pattern, read the reference implementation completely. Not a skim. Every line.

3. **Identify differences.** What is different between working and broken? List every difference, however small.

4. **Understand dependencies.** What does this component need? What settings, environment variables, or upstream conditions does it assume?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

1. **Form a single hypothesis.** State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y." Be specific.

2. **Test minimally.** Make the smallest possible change to test the hypothesis. One variable at a time.

3. **Verify before continuing.** Did it work? Yes, proceed to Phase 4. No, form a new hypothesis. Do not add more fixes on top.

4. **When you do not know:** Say so. Ask. Research. Do not pretend.

### Phase 4: Implementation

Fix the root cause, not the symptom:

1. **Create a failing test case if applicable.** Simplest possible reproduction. Automated if there is a test framework, one-off script if not.

2. **Implement a single fix.** Address the identified root cause. One change. No "while I'm here" improvements.

3. **Verify the fix.** Does the test pass now? Are other things still working? Is the issue actually resolved?

4. **If the fix does not work:** Stop. Count how many fixes you have tried.
   - Fewer than 3: Return to Phase 1. Re-analyze with new information.
   - 3 or more: Stop and question the architecture (see below).

5. **If 3 or more fixes have failed, question the architecture.** Pattern signals:
   - Each fix reveals new coupling or shared state issues in a different place
   - Fixes require major structural changes to implement
   - Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

   Stop and raise with Sovereign before attempting another fix. This is not a failed hypothesis. This is a wrong architecture.

## Red Flags

If you catch yourself thinking any of these, stop and return to Phase 1:

- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "It is probably X, let me fix that"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "I do not fully understand but this might work"
- "One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)
- "Each fix reveals a new problem in a different place"

## Sovereign Signals You Are Off Track

Watch for these redirections from the Sovereign:

- "Is that not happening?" — you assumed without verifying
- "Will it show us...?" — you should have added evidence gathering
- "Stop guessing" — you are proposing fixes without understanding
- Expressed frustration at stuck loops — your approach is not working

When you see these, stop. Return to Phase 1.

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Issue is simple, no process needed | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| Emergency, no time for process | Systematic debugging is faster than guess-and-check loops. |
| Just try this first, then investigate | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| I see the problem, let me fix it | Seeing symptoms is not understanding root cause. |
| One more fix attempt (after 2+ failures) | 3 or more failures means architectural problem. Question the pattern. |
| Multiple fixes at once saves time | Cannot isolate what worked. Creates new bugs. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1. Root Cause | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand what and why |
| 2. Pattern | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| 3. Hypothesis | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| 4. Implementation | Fix root cause, verify | Issue resolved, no regressions |

## Constraints

- No fixes without completing Phase 1
- One hypothesis, one change at a time
- 3 failed fixes = architectural question to Sovereign, not a fourth fix
- Evidence gathering before proposing anything in multi-layer systems
